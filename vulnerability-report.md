#Vulnerability Report

**A1 - Injection**

Since the upload function takes in a request argument, doing some validation on the request.user.is_authenticated, request.user.username, and request.user.id objects would probably be pretty helpful. Alienation and cleansing of the entered data would also be helpful. Parsing it for terms, especially SQL query calls (FROM, SELECT, DROP, *, TABLE) would also be helpful to securing the form.

Or you could just do what the solution says and instantiate a new File class instead of using the curs.execute method at all. 

The site seems really secure seeing as I couldn't even figure out how to upload a task until about 30 minutes in.

```Python
def upload(request, project_id):

    bad_words = ['FROM', 'SELECT', 'DROP', '*', 'TABLE']

    if request.method == 'POST' and request.user.is_authenticated:

        proj = Project.objects.get(pk=project_id)
        form = ProjectFileForm(request.POST, request.FILES)

        if form.is_valid() and request.user:
            name = request.POST.get('name', False)
            upload_path = store_uploaded_file(name, request.FILES['file'])
            
            #A1 - Injection (SQLi)

            check = name.split()
            for item in check:
                if item in bad_words:
                    return HTTPResponseNotFound("You killed me, Jim! Actually you tried to SQL inject us, but we caught you.")

            curs = connection.cursor()
            curs.execute(
                "insert into taskManager_file ('name','path','project_id') values ('%s','%s',%s)" %
                (name, upload_path, project_id))

            # file = File(
            #name = name,
            #path = upload_path,
            # project = proj)

            # file.save()

            return redirect('/taskManager/' + project_id +
                            '/', {'new_file_added': True})
        else:
            form = ProjectFileForm()
    else:
        form = ProjectFileForm()
    return render_to_response(
        'taskManager/upload.html', {'form': form}, RequestContext(request))
```
